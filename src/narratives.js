  START: {
    title: "The Axioms of Cosmic Sociology",
    text: "The universe is a dark forest. Every civilization is an armed hunter stalking through the trees like a ghost, gently pushing aside branches that block the path and trying to tread without sound. Even breathing is done with care.",
    subtext: "You are a nascent civilization. You exist in silence. The safest state is anonymity."
  },
  LISTENING: {
    title: "The Silent Observer",
    text: "You choose the path of caution \u2014 watching the void with bated breath. In the darkness, unseen things move between the stars. Patience is the only shield against the unknown.",
    subtext: "Silence is survival. But even in silence, the forest reveals its nature to those who watch long enough."
  },
  WITNESS: {
    title: "A Distant Fire",
    text: "Somewhere in the void, a civilization broke its silence. You watched its signal bloom like a flower in the dark \u2014 beautiful, brave, and doomed. The hunters saw it too.",
    subtext: "This is the dark forest in action. Every spark of contact becomes a death sentence."
  },
  BROADCASTING: {
    title: "The Chain of Suspicion",
    text: "You have announced your coordinates to the cosmos. Why? Curiosity? Hope? In this forest, revealing your location is a gamble with existence itself.",
    subtext: "Civilizations cannot know if others are benevolent or malicious. But they know that life expands to fill all available space."
  },
  WHISPERING: {
    title: "The Careful Gamble",
    text: "You emit a faint signal \u2014 barely a whisper against the cosmic background noise. Perhaps it will dissipate before reaching hostile ears. Perhaps not. In the dark forest, even a whisper can echo.",
    subtext: "A limited broadcast. Fewer hunters within range, but the risk is never truly zero."
  },
  DETECTED: {
    title: "Technological Explosion",
    text: "A listener has received your signal. To them, you might be a baby today, but a god tomorrow. Given the exponential rate of technological progress, they cannot afford to wait and see.",
    subtext: "Suspicion breeds aggression. The safest move is a preemptive strike."
  },
  DESTROYED: {
    title: "The Cleaning",
    text: "The forest remains silent. Another fire has gone out. This is the Fermi Paradox explained: The universe is full of life, but everyone is hiding.",
    subtext: "In the dark forest, hell is other people."
  },
  SAFE: {
    title: "The Whisper Fades",
    text: "Your signal dissipated into the void without reaching hostile ears. You survive \u2014 this time. But the forest is patient, and your existence hangs on the thin edge between courage and oblivion.",
    subtext: "Survival by luck is not a strategy. The dark forest doesn't forget."
  }
